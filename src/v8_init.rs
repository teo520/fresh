//! V8 platform initialization
//!
//! This is required because:
//! 1. V8 platform must be initialized before any JsRuntime instances are created
//!    See: https://docs.rs/deno_core/latest/deno_core/struct.JsRuntime.html#method.init_platform
//! 2. V8 platform initialization is process-wide and cannot be done more than once
//!    See: https://v8.github.io/api/head/classv8_1_1V8.html (V8::Dispose is permanent)
//! 3. Multiple Editor instances can be created sequentially (e.g., in tests) as long as
//!    they share the same V8 platform initialized once at process startup
//!    See: https://docs.rs/deno_core/latest/deno_core/struct.JsRuntime.html
//!
//! Without this, creating multiple Editor instances sequentially causes segfaults
//! because V8 cannot be reinitialized after disposal.
