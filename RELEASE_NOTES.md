## Release Notes

### v0.1.15 (Unreleased)

#### Features

* **TextMate Grammar Support**: Syntax highlighting now uses TextMate grammars via syntect for languages without tree-sitter support. Includes proper highlighting for Markdown (headings, bold, italic, code, links, quotes, lists).

* **Fuzzy Matching**: Command palette and file browser now use fzf-style fuzzy matching. Matches are highlighted and scored by consecutive characters, word boundaries, and match position.

* **Tab Navigation Commands**: New commands "Go to Next Tab" and "Go to Previous Tab" in the command palette for keyboard-driven tab switching.

* **File Recovery**: Emacs-style auto-recovery for unsaved changes. Buffers are automatically saved every 2 seconds to `~/.local/share/fresh/recovery/`. On startup, automatically recovers unsaved changes from crashed sessions. Uses chunked storage for large files to avoid memory issues.

* **Explorer Menu**: New menu bar entry with file explorer actions (New File, New Folder, Rename, Delete) and keybindings. Disabled items shown in theme colors when not applicable.

* **File Explorer Rename**: Press F2 or use Explorer menu to rename files/folders. Project root is protected from renaming.

* **Emacs-Style Readline Bindings**: Added terminal key equivalents for common operations:
  - Ctrl+A: Home (beginning of line)
  - Ctrl+E: End (end of line)
  - Ctrl+K: Kill to end of line
  - Ctrl+U: Kill to beginning of line
  - Ctrl+W: Kill word backward
  - Alt+D: Kill word forward
  - Ctrl+Y: Yank (paste from kill ring)

#### Bug Fixes

* **Multi-Cursor Selection**: Fixed Ctrl+D selection replacement not working correctly (issue #210).

* **LSP Auto-Restart**: Fixed stopped LSP server incorrectly auto-restarting on edit.

* **File Explorer Selection**: Fixed selection being lost after rename completes.

* **Markdown Highlighting**: Fixed markdown files not getting syntax highlighting for headers, bold, italic, links, etc.

#### Performance

* **Recovery Write Performance**: Removed sync_all from recovery writes, reducing disk I/O overhead.

* **Large File Recovery**: Chunked recovery format applies edits directly without loading entire file into memory.

### v0.1.14

See git history for changes.

---

### v0.1.13

#### Features

* **Git Gutter Plugin**: Shows git diff indicators in the gutter for lines changed vs HEAD:
  - │ (green): Added line
  - │ (yellow): Modified line
  - ▾ (red): Deleted line(s) below

* **Buffer Modified Plugin**: Shows unsaved changes with │ (blue) indicators for lines modified since last save.

* **Line Indicator System**: New plugin API for gutter indicators with automatic position tracking. Indicators use byte-position markers that shift automatically when text is inserted/deleted. Priority system allows multiple indicator types to coexist (diagnostics > git > buffer modified).

* **LCS-Based Line Diff**: Buffer modified indicators now use the classic LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm - the foundation of Unix diff - for accurate change detection. Correctly handles insertions without marking shifted lines as changed, and detects deletion points.

* **Content-Based Diff**: Diff comparison now uses actual byte content rather than piece tree structure. This means if you delete text and paste it back, the indicator correctly clears because the content matches the saved state.

#### Bug Fixes

* **Save As Undo History**: Fixed undo history being cleared after Save As due to auto-revert triggered by file watcher detecting the newly created file. Uses optimistic concurrency with mtime comparison to avoid spurious reverts.

* **Save As Dirty State**: Fixed undo dirty state not being tracked correctly after Save As on unnamed buffers (issue #191).

#### Performance

* **Large File Mode**: Diffing is now disabled in large file mode for performance. Uses the simpler is_modified() flag instead of expensive diff calculations for files with >10MB or unknown line counts.

### v0.1.12

#### Features

* **Live Grep Plugin**: Project-wide search with ripgrep integration and live preview. Search results update as you type (minimum 2 characters), with a split pane showing file context and syntax highlighting. Press Enter to open file at location, ESC to close preview.

* **Calculator Plugin**: Scientific calculator with clickable buttons and keyboard input. Supports parentheses, exponents (^), sqrt, ln, log, trig functions, pi, and e. Mouse click/hover support, copy button for results, and ANSI-colored UI with Unicode box drawing. ESC to close, DEL to clear.

* **File Explorer Improvements**:
  - Shows file sizes (KB/MB/GB) and directory entry counts
  - Close button (×) in title bar to hide explorer
  - Left arrow on file/collapsed directory selects parent
  - Keybinding changed from Ctrl+B to Ctrl+E (avoids tmux conflict)

* **Split View Close Buttons**: Split views now show a × button on the right side of the tab row (only when multiple splits exist) for easy closing.

* **Close Last Buffer**: Closing the last buffer now creates a fresh anonymous buffer instead of blocking with "Cannot close last buffer".

* **Alt+W Keybinding**: New shortcut to close the current tab.

* **Command Palette Source Column**: Shows where each command comes from - "builtin" or the plugin filename - in a right-aligned column.

* **Relative Buffer Names**: Buffer display names are now shown relative to the working directory.

#### Bug Fixes

* **File Explorer Toggle**: Fixed Ctrl+B/Ctrl+E toggle not working correctly - now properly opens/closes instead of just focusing.

* **Session Restore**: Fixed file explorer not initializing when restoring a session with explorer visible.

* **Open File Popup**: Hide status bar when file browser popup is shown; improved high-contrast theme colors (cyan instead of yellow).

### v0.1.11

See git history for changes.

---

### v0.1.10

#### Features

* **Session Persistence**: Automatically saves per-project state (open files, tabs, split layout, cursor/scroll positions, file explorer state, search/replace history and options, bookmarks) to the XDG data dir and restores it on launch. Session restore is skipped when opening a specific file; use `--no-session` to start fresh.

* **Unified Search & Replace**: Replace (Ctrl+H) and Query Replace (Ctrl+Shift+H) now share the same interface with a "Confirm each" toggle (Alt+E). Query Replace enables confirmation by default; Replace uses the toggle state. Confirmation prompt shows `(y)es (n)o (a)ll (c)ancel` options.

#### Bug Fixes

* **Session Restore Reliability**: Fixed session rehydration to reopen files/splits with the correct active buffer, cursor, and scroll position (including nested splits) instead of jumping back to the top on first render.

* **macOS Build**: Fixed Linux-specific `.init_array` by using cross-platform V8 initialization.

* **Syntax Highlighting**: Fixed invisible/hard-to-read highlighting in light and nostalgia themes by using theme-based color resolution instead of hardcoded colors.

* **Theme Colors**: Improved status bar and prompt colors across all themes (dark, high-contrast, light, nostalgia).

* **Search Prompt**: Search/replace prompts now cancel when focus leaves the editor (switching buffers or focusing file explorer).

### v0.1.9

#### Features

* **Native File Browser**: New built-in file browser for Open File command (Ctrl+O) that works without plugins. Features sortable columns (name, size, modified), navigation shortcuts (parent, home, root), filtering with grayed non-matches, mouse support with hover indicators, and async directory loading.

* **CRLF Line Ending Support**: Transparent handling of Windows-style line endings. Files are detected and normalized internally, then saved with their original line ending format preserved.

* **CLI Enhancements**: Added `--version`, `--no-plugins` (skip JS runtime for faster startup), `--log-file`, and `--config` flags.

* **UI Improvements**:
  - Tab hover effects with close button changing to red on hover
  - Menu hover-to-switch when a menu is open
  - Buffer name shown in modified buffer confirmation prompts
  - Fixed column widths in command palette for stable layout

#### Bug Fixes

* **V8 Segfault**: Fixed crash when creating multiple Editor instances (e.g., in tests) by initializing V8 platform once at library load.

* **Windows**: Fixed duplicate key presses caused by processing both Press and Release events.

---

### v0.1.8

#### Bug Fixes

* **Open File Prompt**: Fixed completions not showing immediately (issue #193) by enabling ICU support for Unicode functions.

* **Keyboard Shortcuts Help**: Fixed crash when reopening keyboard shortcuts buffer (issue #192).

* **Undo Save Points**: Fixed extra undo step at beginning of save history (issue #191).

* **Scroll Keybindings**: Fixed Ctrl+Up/Down scroll not working by syncing viewport between SplitViewState and EditorState.

---

### v0.1.7

#### Features

* **Select Theme Command**: New theme picker accessible from the command palette and View menu. Includes a new "nostalgia" theme inspired by Turbo Pascal 5 / WordPerfect 5.

* **Compose Mode Improvements**: Paper-on-desk visual effect with desk margin colors, and hanging indent support for markdown lists and blockquotes.

* **Binary File Detection**: Binary files are now detected and opened in read-only mode to prevent accidental corruption.

#### Bug Fixes

* **Light Theme**: Fixed colors for status bar, prompt, scrollbar, tabs, and file explorer to use proper light theme colors.

* **Mouse Performance**: Fixed slow mouse movement on large terminals by skipping redundant renders when hover target hasn't changed. Added mouse event coalescing to skip stale positions.

* **UTF-8 Truncation**: Fixed panic when truncating suggestion descriptions mid-character.

#### Internal Changes

* **Code Refactoring**: Major cleanup extracting helpers and reducing duplication across many modules including `process_async_messages`, `handle_plugin_command`, `render_view_lines`, `multi_cursor`, `highlight_color`, and more. Consolidated duplicate `hook_args_to_json` implementations.

* **Test Improvements**: Fixed flaky tests by removing timing assertions, made shortcut tests platform-aware for macOS.

* **Documentation**: Reorganized internal planning docs, updated plugin README from Lua to TypeScript, and added embedded help manual using `include_str!()`.
